Configure Nginx for static website (Beginnerâ€™s Guide)

# What is NGINX?
  
  NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

# NGINX as a Web Server?

  It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. NGINX is a powerful web server software used by several hosting companies. Therefore, it offers faster loading times and better performance than most other web servers.Additionally, NGINX uses fewer resources and hardware than other server software.The main purpose of the master process is to read and evaluate configuration files, as well as maintain the worker processes.The worker processes do the actual processing of requests. The number of worker processes is defined by the worker processes directive in the <code>nginx.conf</code> configuration file and can either be set to a fixed number or configured to adjust automatically to the number of available CPU cores.

# Starting the NGINX
